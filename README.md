# Calculator
Replication of Swift Calculator App from Stanford CS193P 2017

This repository is a replication of the Swift Calculator App demonstrated in the 2017 Stanford CS193P Developing iOS 10 Apps with Swift Course
The code in this repository comes form the first two lectures of the course.

Links to those lectures can be found here:
Lecture 1: https://youtu.be/ilQ-tq772VI
Lecture 2: https://youtu.be/-auG-myu02Q

The two files of note in this repository are Calculator/ViewController.swift (the Controller of the app) and Calculator/CalculatorBrain.swift (the model of the app)
While the code comes from the lectures, the comments in ViewController.swift and Calculator/CalculatorBrain.swift are original and completely my own.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the concepts that I have learned about Swift from this free online course.
These concepts include, basic Swift syntax, using let, optionals, computed properties, enums, and closures.
